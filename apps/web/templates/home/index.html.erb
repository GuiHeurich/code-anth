CoodeAnth is the intersection between coding and anthropology.<br> 
Coding is software making. Anthropology is research about people.<br>
What could that intersection look like? That is what we are trying to find out with CodeAnth.<br>
You are welcome to be a part of it.<br>

We currently hold an online LRG (learning and research group).<br>
We read something and discuss it, hoping to gain something out of it.<br>
We think that will help us figuring out what CodeAnth could be.<br>
