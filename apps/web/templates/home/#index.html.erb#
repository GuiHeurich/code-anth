Coding is making software. Anthropology is researching people.<br>
What could the intersection between them be?<br>
That is what we are trying to find out with CodeAnth.<br>
<br>
You are welcome to be a part of it.<br>
</p>

<br>
<p>CodeAnth is currently based on two related activities: <br>
  (i) fieldwork with ruby developers, and <br>
  (ii) a reading group.

We currently hold an online LRG (learning and research group).<br>
We read something and discuss it, hoping to gain something out of it.<br>
We think that will help us figuring out what CodeAnth could be.<br>
